				<h4 class="content__subtitle">Partner - Sales</h4>
				<div class="content__text">Chris Perkins is an expert in quantitative and qualitative analysis having
					conducted and analyzed survey data for over a decade on behalf of Republican candidates. Perkins is
					considered one of the top public opinion experts in the United States and has been cited as among
					the most accurate pollsters in the country.

					In the 2010 – 2016 election cycles, Perkins polled for nearly one hundred winning Republican
					candidates for the State Legislature, US House of Representatives, US Senate, Governor and other
					statewide offices. Perkins has conducted public opinion research in Arizona, Arkansas, California,
					Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,
					Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia,
					Washington and Texas.

					In Texas, Perkins was named the top pollster by Capitol Inside’s bi-partisan “Texas Power
					Consultants” rankings for three consecutive election cycles, and is widely recognized to have been
					the most accurate pollster conducting surveys in Texas since 2010.

					In addition to his political work, Perkins has conducted quantitative and qualitative research on
					behalf of numerous Fortune 500 companies, trade associations and non-profit organizations worldwide.

					Back in the days, Perkins ran the independent expenditure (IE) unit for the Republican National
					Committee, overseeing US House and Senate IE’s in multiple states.

					Before his time at the RNC, Perkins was the director of Americans for a Republican Majority PAC, the
					leadership PAC of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay.

					Currently Perkins teaches ‘Polling and Targeting’ for the Annette Straus Institute’s New Politics
					Forum at the University of Texas at Austin, which provides UT students a bi-partisan look at the way
					modern political campaigns are conducted.

					By formulating data and understanding the variables necessary to deliver a specifically targeted
					message for each constituency, Perkins’ clients win.</div>
