        <p>Chris Perkins
            is an expert in quantitative and qualitative analysis. He’s considered one of the most
            accurate pollsters and top public opinion experts in the United States. Since 2010, Chris has polled for
            nearly one hundred winning Republican candidates for Governor,
            U.S. Senate, U.S. Congress, and a
            variety of other offices. Chris has also been a key resource for numerous organizations tackling public
            policy issues, including Fortune 500s, trade associations, and non
            -
            profit organizations.</p>
        <p>When he's not wading through
            petabytes of data,
            Chris can usually be found at one of his kids’ baseball
            games, hosting friends to some of the best block parties in Austin, or explaining the virtues of Austin
            barbecue to the uninitiated. And rest assured, while Chris’ barbecue is neve
            r over seasoned, his highly
            detailed memory of every campaign he's ever touched intimidates even his most seasoned employees.</p>
